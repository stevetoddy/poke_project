## Overview

Battle two Pokemon against each other!

Battles are decided by using the Pokemon's type, utilsing the type matrix from Pokemon Wiki here: https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Types

## Screenshot

Include screenshots of your app to showcase its appearance and layout.

## External API(s)

- [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)

I have used the PokeAPI to get pokemon information including images, crys (sounds), types and names. 

## Unsolved Problems

The battle algorithm is too verbose and is heavly weighted in player ones favor. I would like to redefine and refactor this at a later date.  

## Future Features

- Better battle animations 
- Battles based on more than just type (eg using the moves list provided by the API and turn based auto battling)
